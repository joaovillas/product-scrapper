## Product Scrapper

Hello there, this is a project to company [Pelando](https://beta.pelando.com.br/destaques) and the challenge is for creating an service to crawl a page for given URL

#### For simplify the project only two websites are allowed:
* [Pontofrio](https://www.pontofrio.com.br/)
* [Centauro](https://www.centauro.com.br/)

If you try another domains you'll get an error saying that the domain is not allowed ... 

```javascript
{
	"error": {
		"message": [
			"Error: This domain is not allowed"
		]
	}
}
```

`docker-compose up -d`

And success  ðŸš€ you're ready to run

** Make Sure you have an database working to connect** 

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://{DATABASE_USERNAME}:{DATABASE_PASSWORD}@{DATABASE_IP}:5432/{DATABASE_NAME}?schema=public"
```

yarn prisma:generate
yarn prisma:up
